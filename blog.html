                    <h1>The monkey experiment;</br> an obligatory introduction. </h1>
                    <p>
                        As it says on my about page, howdy! I'm Griffin. To keep 
                        introductions short, I'll leave it to those who are interested
                        to mosey on over to the about page for more general information
                        on who I am, what I've done, and why you should love me now 
                        that I'm making my groundbreaking internet debut. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, you may be asking, what groundbreaking will I be doing? What 
                        should one even expect from this pastel-orange, Wes-Anderson-esque 
                        page that, to be honest, looks about as inspired as any artsy 
                        20-something year-old's loosely-assembled Tumblr blog. Well, returning
                        your honesty, I'll say that I'm not too sure. Part of me wants this
                        blog to exhibit a sort-of stream-of-concious style. I could post about 
                        projects, research, momentary obsessions; you name it! I'd also like 
                        some of the content which ends up here to serve an educational
                        purpose, if it could. Now that I'm out of University, there are a lot 
                        of things I'd that like to play around with; maybe my own documentation
                        could help someone who's just as interested in the same things. At this 
                        point, all I can say for sure is that there's going to be a lot of 
                        experimentation, so just sit back and bear with me! It's going to be
                        an alright time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       And like my dad once said (to be precise, today), "it's like the
                       monkey experiment. Give him cigarettes if you want a 
                       novel in 60 days." I'll take my cigarettes coffee-in-a-jar style 
                       and we'll see if I can crank out something interesting in sixty days plus.
                       Wish me luck.
