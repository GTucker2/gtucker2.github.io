                    <h1>Experimenting with AI Mediocrity - Unity 3D Checkers</h1>
                    <p>
                            When I asked how I could implement a checkers AI, my dad, hovering nearby, asked "what if it was convincingly bad?"
                            This is an attempt at that; a checkers AI which is believably terrible. Not one that throws its pieces recklessly
                            in front of the oponent's, but one that makes convincingly bad plays. Alongside this little experiment I am also 
                            attempting to make a good checkers AI. I feel like some engineer somewhere would be rolling in their grave if I didn't.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                            For those who'd like to follow along more closely, I've opened <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/GTucker2/UnityCheckers">a Git repo</a> where folks can check out the source code 
                            as it develops. I'll also be posting updates as I progress. When I feel like things have reached a point where the 
                            project has become polished and interesting enough for anyone other than myself, I'll post a download link to the .exe 
                            as well.
