                            When I asked how I could implement a checkers AI, my dad, hovering nearby, asked "what if it was convincingly bad?"
                            This is an attempt at that; a checkers AI which is believably terrible. Not one that throws its pieces recklessly
                            in front of the oponent's, but one that makes convincingly bad plays. Alongside this little experiment I am also 
                            attempting to make a good checkers AI. I feel like some engineer somewhere would be rolling in their grave if I didn't.
                            All code is written in C#, built around the Unity engine.

                                Developed by a team within the Office for Mathematics, Science and Technology Education under the 
                                University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Education, the Clarify water treatment simulation allows 
                                the user to design their state-of-the-art wastewater treatment fascility. Recognizing the tradeoffs between 
                                treatment processes, the user and select which processes to include in their system in order to design
                                the most-optimized facility. Alongsize my team, I worked to design and implement the entire frontend of Project
                                Clarify. All aspects of the Project Clarify UI are implemented in C# and through the Unity Engine. While my focus 
                                for this project was in design and frontend development, I did join our backend team in implementing the database
                                functionality used by web versions of the project.
