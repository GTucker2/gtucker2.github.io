                <h2>Howdy! I'm Griffin.</h2>
                <p>I'm a graduate of the University of Illinois
                    at Urbana-Champaign with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. 
                    I'm a semi-seasoned frontend developer with a special 
                    passion for illustration and design.
                </p>
                <h2>Professional history.</h2>
                <p>
                    For four years, I worked with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
                    href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/robblind">Robb Lindgren</a> and 
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mste.illinois.edu/profile/996">
                    Sammy Lindgren</a>, project leaders with the University of Illinois College of 
                    Education and the Office for Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education respectively, 
                    as a developer, illustrator, and UI/UX designer to develop educational simulations and 
                    demos for educating students of all ages in STEM topics. Our largest and most ambitious 
                    project together, an educational simulation of the midwestern water treatment process had
                    me touring the State of Illinois and observing water treatment facilities for the collection 
                    of data and visual notes that I later used in the design and implementation of the project's 
                    user interface. Read more at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                <h2>Special interests.</h2>
                <p>
                    My history as a UI/UX designer ties into my love for illustration and graphic design; watercolor
                    is especially a good time. I've also always aspired to design my own games, taking inspiration from 
                    the amazing independent projects of the past ten years. Owlboy, Fez, Night in the Woods, and Rain
                    World are all killer. Tieing into that, check out Scalapede, my Centipede clone in Scala! Right now
                    I'm really into game design through functional programming. Some other technical interests include: 
                    data visualization, AI and machine learning, and NLP. 
                </p>

                    I took my minor in Scandinavian Studies, so naturally I'll link my favorite content from the 
                    north. If you need a good read, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Glas">Doctor Glas</a> (Hjalmar Söderberg) is great 
                    for an evening. Some other goodies include: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Stealing_Horses">Out Stealing Horses</a> (Per Petterson), 
                    the Ice Palace (Terjei Vesaas), and anything of Tove Jansson's. My favorite folktale is East 
                    of the Sun and West of the Moon; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                    And for the brave souls with pleanty of time on their hands, <a target="_blank" 
                    rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_and_Alexander">
                    Fanny and Alexander</a> (Ingmar Bergman) is a great SIX HOUR film. Anyone who can make it through
                    the experience gets a wink and finger-guns from me.
