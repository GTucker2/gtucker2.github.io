                    <h1>What Kind of T?</br>The Ever-Harrowing Question of</br>Post-Collegiate Self-Dimension.</h1>
                    <p>
                        In university, I would hear alot about the 'T' model. It's a way to shape your 
                        professional self. Ideally, as a 'T', you know so much about one thing while at the same time
                        knowing a bit of everything else. Now-a-days, I find myself wondering about exactly what kind of
                        'T' I want to be, and recently, this question has been driving how I think about project planning 
                        in addition to how I try to use all of this newly-graduated, alone-in-the-apartment free
                        time I've been awarded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the record, currently, I am unemployed. Maybe you find yourself in the same situation; maybe not. 
                        I state this as a bit of a disclaimer, because, ultimately, some people just don't have the
                        same kind of schedule (or lack of a schedule) as I do right now. Regardless, I hope you can read this 
                        and scrape a bit of use or introspection out of it. For me, this is a way to process what's going 
                        on right now. It's a way for me to help organize and structure the nothing, so maybe it can help you 
                        organize and structure the nothing too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm the kind of folk who likes to stay busy, so right now is an especially awkward time for me. As a result,
                        I find myself wanting to engaged in project after project, kind of like how it was in uni, though, I ask myself,
                        is this really the best way to use my time? Drawing back to the cheesey 'T' model, am I being the best 'T' that 
                        I could be? Gripping question, I know. I see it like this; you can either be one of two 'T's: 
                        big bar up top or long bar in the middle, and bear with me, as I'll try to limit the poorly-worded spacial 
                        analogies from here on out. Right now, I'm the former: a big ol' top bar with a lot of ideas; a tiny middle bar
                        that's a bit unassuming. All of college I was a 'T' number one; I worked a lot of different projects and I 
                        jumped around on a lot of different teams. The environment was perfect for this kind of professional lifestyle. 
                        Now, however, maybe it's time to become that second T. A 'T' with a specialty (A special 'T', so to speak). I 
                        really want to be that guy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So where does this play into what's going on for me right now? At the moment, I find myself spreading myself 
                        thin over all of these different projects. I have next to a million different interests, and I've 
                        always been the kind of person who wants to mess with them all. Maybe I lack dicipline, but maybe this is a great time
                        to grow with respect to that! I really want to make something that helps me stand out; something that grows my 
                        middle bar; something that helps other folks out. I've got some ideas, so now, it's just about picking one 
                        and running with it.

                    <h1>The monkey experiment;</br>an obligatory introduction. </h1>
                    <p>
                        As it says on my about page, howdy! I'm Griffin. To keep 
                        introductions short, I'll leave it to those who are interested
                        to mosey on over to the about page for more general information
                        on who I am, what I've done, and why you should love me now 
                        that I'm making my groundbreaking internet debut. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, you may be asking, what groundbreaking will I be doing? What 
                        should one even expect from this pastel-orange, Wes-Anderson-esque 
                        page that, to be honest, looks about as inspired as any artsy 
                        20-something year-old's loosely-assembled Tumblr blog. Well, returning
                        your honesty, I'll say that I'm not too sure. Part of me wants this
                        blog to exhibit a sort-of stream-of-concious style. I could post about 
                        projects, research, momentary obsessions; you name it! I'd also like 
                        some of the content which ends up here to serve an educational
                        purpose, if it could. Now that I'm out of University, there are a lot 
                        of things I'd that like to play around with; maybe my own documentation
                        could help someone who's just as interested in the same things. At this 
                        point, all I can say for sure is that there's going to be a lot of 
                        experimentation, so just sit back and bear with me! It's going to be
                        an alright time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       And like my dad once said (to be precise, today), "it's like the
                       monkey experiment. Give him cigarettes if you want a 
                       novel in 60 days." I'll take my cigarettes coffee-in-a-jar style 
                       and we'll see if I can crank out something interesting in sixty days plus.
                       Wish me luck.
